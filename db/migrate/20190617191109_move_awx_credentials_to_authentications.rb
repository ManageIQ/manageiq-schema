  # The only real portions from this that are from the `awx` side are for the

  #

    # irrelevant, but everything else is mostly as it is on the python
    # equivalent.
    #
    # The only diverging change was that we initialize the @cipher and @hmac (for
    # verification) here instead of in the methods that use them (found in the
    # `cryptography` base class).

    #   https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/blob/ed5a7717/src/cryptography/fernet.py#L105-L122
    #
    # The verify bit will be described below, but the bulk of what is in the
    # cryptography lib can simply be replaced with the cipher decrypt
    # functionality in Ruby's OpenSSL implementation.
    #
    # Since the fernet lib is also in charge of a decent amount of FFI
    # interplay that the OpenSSL equivalent in Ruby takes care of for us in
    # its C implementation directly, so if this looks a bit simpler, that is
    # because it is.
    #
    # Of note from the above:  Because of how the string slicing works in
    # python and differs from the notation in ruby, there looks to be "off by
    # one" errors all over the place, but that is intentional.  For example,
    # for the `cipher.iv` assignment, in python it is:
    #
    #   iv = data[9:25]
    #
    # Which translates to "start at the 9th char, and bring back everything to
    # the 25 char", where in ruby it is:
    #
    #   iv = data[9,16]
    #
    # "bring back 16 characters starting from the 9th char".  There is no ":"
    # notation available, a equivalent translation had to be made.

    #
    # And for the most part, is equivalent in nature.
    #
    # The big thing of note is the `hmac.digest == signature` portion, which is
    # slightly "less secure" in this implementation.  I say that since the
    # `.verify` implementation in the python version from above does a
    # `constant_time.bytes_eq` call:
    #
    #   https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/blob/ed5a7717/src/cryptography/hazmat/backends/openssl/hmac.py#L70-L73
    #

    # ruby equivalent available, but one is in the works:
    #
    #   https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/10098
    #

    # is confusing about where the `.verify` method comes from in the python
    # implementation.
