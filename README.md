SQL Schema and migrations for ManageIQ.

## Development

See the section on plugins in the [ManageIQ Developer Setup](http://manageiq.org/docs/guides/developer_setup/plugins)

For quick local setup run `bin/setup`, which will clone the core ManageIQ repository under the *spec* directory and setup necessary config files. If you have already cloned it, you can run `bin/update` to bring the core ManageIQ code up to date.

### Testing

Unlike other ManageIQ plugins, the schema plugin uses a dummy application in spec/dummy instead of the usual spec/manageiq. This ensure that schema migrations are not dependent on any models or files in ManageIQ core.

To run the tests:

1. If necessary, copy `spec/dummy/config/database.tmpl.yml` to `spec/dummy/config/database.yml` and modify it to access your local database
2. Run: `bin/setup`
   - Copies `spec/dummy/config/database.tmpl.yml` to `spec/dummy/config/database.yml` if it doesn't exist
   - Performs `bundle update`
   - Generates random database region number
   - Creates/resets `dummy_test` database
3. Run: `rspec spec/migrations/<spec_file>` or `rake` (Run all migration tests)
