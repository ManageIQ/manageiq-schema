# This file eases your Rails 8.0 framework defaults upgrade.
#
# Uncomment each configuration one by one to switch to the new default.
# Once your application is ready to run with all new defaults, you can remove
# this file and set the `config.load_defaults` to `8.0`.

# Read the Guide for Upgrading Ruby on Rails for more info on each option.

# No new framework defaults for Rails 8.0.
# If you're upgrading from Rails 7.2, the defaults are already set.
#
# Note: since we test with possibly multiple rails versions, any defaults we set
# here should be backwards compatible or they'd need to be dynamically added only
# for rails versions that support it.
